# Game of Life for HarmonyOS

The 生命游戏 / Game of Life app (`net.lazyjazz.gameoflife`): an ArkUI page over the
desktop Game of Life from LongMarch (`../LongMarch/demo/gol`), rendered with
LongMarch's Vulkan backend into an XComponent surface.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AppScope/` | Bundle name, version, app name (en/zh) and the layered icon (`demo/gol/tools/app_icon.py`) |
| `entry/src/main/ets/entryability/EntryAbility.ets` | Fullscreen window, native initialization, foreground/background |
| `entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets` | Game page: touch and pinch input, gravity-turned icons, grid-size popover, pattern library |
| `entry/src/main/resources/` | Strings (en/zh) and the bundled game resources (`rawfile/Resources`, generated) |
| `entry/src/main/cpp/` | Native build entry for DevEco; builds `native/` |
| `native/` | N-API bridge, render-thread host, Vulkan presentation and the hosted game session |
| `prepare_resources.py` | Stages the patterns and SPIR-V shaders into `rawfile/Resources` |
| `build_hap.sh` | Command-line HAP and `.app` builds |

## Build

Install the shared mobile dependencies once (`../mobile`), into `../out/mobile/deps`
or a directory named by `LONGMARCH_MOBILE_DEPS`. Then stage the game's prepared
resources, which hold the pattern library and the SPIR-V the game requests:

```sh
python3 harmonyos/prepare_resources.py --source <GameOfLifeResources>
sh harmonyos/build_hap.sh
```

The source is a game resource folder prepared by LongMarch's iOS tools
(`prepare_game_resources.py`); only its `slang-*` SPIR-V entries are staged. A
staged bundle is tied to the Slang compiler that prepared it.

## Signing

`build-profile.json5` is committed without signing material. Add signing
configurations locally (DevEco Studio's automatic signing, or AppGallery Connect
certificates and profiles for `net.lazyjazz.gameoflife`) and set the product's
`signingConfig`, but do not commit them. A debug profile installs on registered
devices; for AppGallery, use the release profile and build the `.app` package:

```sh
BUILD_MODE=release TASK=assembleApp sh harmonyos/build_hap.sh
```

The package is written to `build/outputs/default/harmonyos-default-signed.app`.

## Behavior

- The page opens the game as soon as the bundled resources are extracted.
- The interface keeps the orientation the game opened in; the gravity sensor turns
  the icons only after explicit opt-in and only while the page is visible in the
  foreground. Declining keeps icons fixed without restricting gameplay. The
  pattern-library footer provides Privacy & Icon Rotation to read the notice
  and revoke consent. Old installations without a consent record default to off.
- One finger edits cells or pans an enlarged grid; two fingers pan and pinch.
- Open and save start in the in-app pattern library (736 Life Lexicon patterns in
  folders, plus My Patterns); the system document picker is one link away.
- Built-in patterns are adapted from the Life Lexicon by Stephen A. Silver et al.,

## Privacy regression check

The consent test executes the production page methods with storage and sensor
substitutes (no real sensor access):

```sh
node harmonyos/tests/privacy_consent.cjs <typescript/lib/typescript.js>
```

Also compile `default@CompileArkTS`. Before shipping, verify on a real phone:
first launch and upgrade start with no subscription; declining survives restart;
accepting enables icon rotation; background/page-hide stops reading; returning
resumes only when consent remains enabled; revoking stops immediately and stays
revoked after restart. The privacy entry is in the pattern-library footer.

AppGallery privacy labels: collects personal information = Yes; purpose = App
functionality; category = Device information; item = Gravity sensor information.
Do not select analytics, advertising, third-party disclosure or cross-border
transfer for these locally processed readings. Keep the public policy and the
in-app English/Chinese disclosures aligned. No new manifest permission is needed
for GRAVITY; absence of a permission prompt is not absence of data processing.
